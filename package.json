npx cypress open
# or if you prefer a script, add one like \"cypress:open\": \"cypress open\"\n```

Next steps I can do (pick any)
- Add JUnit or Mochawesome reporter and upload test-results so GitHub Actions shows annotations.
- Use the official `cypress-io/github-action` to simplify setup and caching further (I kept a minimal plain approach for clarity).
- Remove or update the old `cypress/workflows/cypress_test.yaml` to avoid confusion.
- Run a local CI dry-run (I can run `npm ci` and `npm run test:ci` here if you want — it will actually execute your tests locally).

Quality gates
- Build: PASS — edits are JSON/YAML valid (package.json and workflow file updated).
- Lint/Typecheck: N/A for this repo.
- Tests: I did not run the tests to avoid executing your test suite without permission; run `npm run test:ci` locally or I can execute if you want.

If you'd like, I can:
- Switch the workflow to use `cypress-io/github-action@v5` which can provide automatic caching and nicer integration (I can update the workflow to that).
- Add reporters and a failing-test upload strategy so CI fails produce JUnit XML and are visible in PR checks.
